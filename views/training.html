		<p>
			My name is Casandra, and I'm a dog trainer at Pets-R-Us. I love helping
			dog owners train their dog. When you don't know how to train your pet, it
			can be hard to connect with them and turn the bond into something
			meaningful and rewarding. <br />To help dog owners build those connections
			with their pets and learn how to communicate effectively with them, I
			focus on using positive reinforcement methods in order to teach your dog
			what you want them to do.

		<p>
			Hello, I'm Jack, and I specialize in training dogs. It can be confusing
			for a dog owner to know how to train their dog without knowing how it
			thinks or feels. To help people understand and connect with their pets I
			use positive reinforcement to teach them what they want from their
			dogs.<br />
			When you love your dog but feel like you're struggling to communicate
			effectively, I can help!
